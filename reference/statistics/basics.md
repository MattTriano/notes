# Basic Statistical Concepts

* Null Hypothesis
    * The hypothesis that a treatment does not produce a statistically significant difference in output compared to a control.

* Error types
    * Type I error:
        * When the null hypothesis is true (ie no difference between treatment and control) but the analysis indicates the null hypothesis should be rejected.
    * Type II error:
        * When the null hypothesis is false (ie there is a significant difference between treatment and control) but the analysis indicates the null hypothesis should be accepted.

* Confidence Level
    * The probability that the value of a parameter falls within a specified range of values.

* Statistical Power
    * The probability that a significance test will detect a significant difference from the null hypothesis if there exists a significant difference.
    * Statistical power is positively correlated with n (number of samples) increases and negatively correlated with confidence level.
