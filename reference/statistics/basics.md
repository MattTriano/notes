# Basic Statistical Concepts

* Null Hypothesis
    * The hypothesis that a treatment does not produce a statistically significant difference in output compared to a control.

* p-value
    * The p-value (or probability value) is the probability of observing a test statistic $t$ at least as extreme as $t$ if the null hypothesis is true. For example, suppose you had been growing green beans in your garden for years from a seed packet you bought at the local gardening center and most grew to be between 4-8 inches long but some were a bit longer and some a bit shorter. You never really looked hard at the packet of green beans and didn't notice the name of the cultivar, but in this year's harvest, you've grown some beans that were 30 inches long. If you assume that you planted the same cultivar this year as in prior years (ie the null hypothesis), what's the probability of observing beans that long? The probability would be exceptionally low, so you could reject the null hypothesis. But if you were only observing beans 9 inches long, the probability of observing a bean that long would be fairly high, so you wouldn't reject the null hypothesis.

* Error types
    * Type I error:
        * When the null hypothesis is true (ie no difference between treatment and control) but the analysis indicates the null hypothesis should be rejected.
    * Type II error:
        * When the null hypothesis is false (ie there is a significant difference between treatment and control) but the analysis indicates the null hypothesis should be accepted.

* Confidence Level
    * The probability that the value of a parameter falls within a specified range of values.

* Statistical Power
    * The probability that a significance test will detect a significant difference from the null hypothesis if there exists a significant difference.
    * Statistical power is positively correlated with n (number of samples) increases and negatively correlated with confidence level.
