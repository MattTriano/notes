# Linux CLI tools

The linux command line is an incredibly powerful interface for interacting with your machine, and that power is provided by a vast set of command line tools. Here are some very useful command line tools:

## `ls`
`ls` lists the contents of a directory along with file information like size, user/group permissions, last modified date, etc.

## `tree`
`tree` lists the contents of a directory's subdirectories in a tree-like format, along with file and directory information.

Use `tree -du -h` to show the total size of each directory (including subdir contents) in a `-h`uman-readable format.

## `cd`
`cd` changes the current working directory to the entered relative or absolute path, enabling navigation of a directory structure.

## `grep`
`grep` searches through files for a given pattern or substring.

## `find`

`find` searches directories for files with a name matching/containing a pattern or substring.

## `sed`
`sed` filters and/or transforms an input text stream.

## `du`
`du` tells you about disk usage. 

## `ps`
`ps` displays running processes and their state.

## `file`
`file` examines a file, determines the file type, and prints out the file's type and encoding (it's more than just the file's extension).

## `head` and `tail`
`head` prints out the first 10 lines of a file.
`tail` prints out the last 10 lines of a file.

Use the `-n` flag to specify the number of lines.
