# Raspberry Pi


## Remote Access

### Remote access of files

To remotely access files on your raspberry pi via SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol), 
1. Get the IP of your raspberry pi that has the files you want to access
2. (in a browser) go to `sftp://<insert IP address here>` (should look like `sftp://123.456.7.89`)
